* **Track Progress:** Students can upload drafts and receive feedback, schedule the thesis exam
* **Administration:** Secretaries have full oversight of pending, active and rejected theses and officialy finalize them.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (Vanilla)
* **Backend:** PHP (Native)
* **Database:** MySQL
* **Data Visualization:** Chart.js (used for statistics)

## 📂 Project Structure
The codebase is structured to separate logic (PHP), webpages (HTML), styling (CSS), and interactivity (JS):

```text
├── css/                  # Styling for specific user roles (foititis.css, kathigitis.css, etc.)
├── html/                 # User Interface and views (Login forms, Dashboard layouts)
├── js/                   # Frontend logic (AJAX calls, form validation, charts)
├── php/                  # Backend logic (Authentication, Database connection, CRUD operations)
│   ├── database.php      # Database connection configuration
│   ├── auth_check.php    # Middleware to check user login status
│   └── ... (API endpoints)
└── uploads/              # Storage for uploaded thesis drafts and notes
```

## 🚀 How to Run Locally

Since this project uses Native PHP and MySQL, you will need a local server environment (like **XAMPP** or **WAMP**) to run it.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/vasizaf/University-Thesis-Manager-Web-App.git](https://github.com/vasizaf/University-Thesis-Manager-Web-App.git)
   ```
  
2.  **Move the folder:**
    * Copy the project folder.
    * Paste it inside your local server's root directory:
        * **XAMPP:** `C:\xampp\htdocs\`
        * **WAMP:** `C:\wamp64\www\`

3.  **Setup the Database:**
    * Open phpMyAdmin (usually `http://localhost/phpmyadmin`).
    * Create a new database named `thesis_db` (⚠️ Check your `php/database.php` file to confirm the exact name expected).
    * Import the `.sql` file provided in this repo to create the necessary tables.

4.  **Configure Connection:**
    * Open the `php/database.php` file.
    * Ensure the `$username` (usually `root`) and `$password` (usually empty for XAMPP) match your local server setup.

5.  **Run the App:**
    * Start Apache and MySQL in XAMPP/WAMP.
    * Open your browser and visit: `http://localhost/thesis-management-system/html/login.html`
